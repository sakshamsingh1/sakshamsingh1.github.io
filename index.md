## About Me

I am a Master's student at NYU, Courant and a research assistant in the [Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl), NYU.
I am advised by Prof. [Magdalena Fuentes](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/) and Dr. [Iran Roman](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~iran/).
My research interests lie in multimodal deep learning and machine listening.  

Prior to joining NYU, I worked as Machine learning engineer II at Zomato and Senior Data Scientist at Sharechat. 
While in industry I applied ML to solve problems in user recommendation and personalization. 
I received my B.Tech degree in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Delhi. 

In my spare time I like to play [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdkc_DZCi8VtEiH1YYKrD5w) and tennis.
