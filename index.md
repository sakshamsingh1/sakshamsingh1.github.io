## About Me
I am second-year CS Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas under [Dr. Yapeng Tian](https://www.yapengtian.com/).
Previously, I did my MS in CS at NYU Courant where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Juan Pablo Bello](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-pablo-bello), [Dr. Magdalena Fuentes](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/), [Dr. Iran Roman](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~iran/) at [Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl).
My research interests lie in multimodal deep learning and machine listening.  

Prior to joining NYU, I worked as a machine learning engineer II at Zomato and as a senior data scientist at Sharechat. 
While in industry I applied ML to solve problems in user recommendation and personalization. 
I received my B.Tech degree in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Delhi. 

In my spare time, I like to play [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdkc_DZCi8VtEiH1YYKrD5w) and tennis.
